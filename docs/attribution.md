### Where to attribute

Attribution needs to "appear in a place that is reasonable to the medium or means you are utilising." [Specific examples](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/License#Where_to_put_it.3F) are given by the OSM Foundation and are generally best practices for giving credit to any source.

## The fine print
